This is a template example for lab journaling. Students in the data science courses at the Institute of Entrepreneurship will use this template to learn R for business analytics. Students can replace this text as they wish.

## First Test Code/Function

roll3 \<- function(faces = 1:6, number_of_dice = 1) {

dice \<- sample(x = faces, size = number_of_dice,

```         
             replace = TRUE, 
             
             
             prob = c(0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.5))
             
             
```

sum(dice)

}

# You can run the function 100 times, store the results and plot a histogram to varify your function

results \<- replicate(n = 200, expr = roll3(), simplify=TRUE) hist(results)

## How to use

1.  Accept the assignment and get your own github repo.

2.  Blog/journal what you are doing in R, by editing the `.qmd` files.

3.  See the links page for lots of helpful links on learning R.

4.  Change everything to make it your own.

5.  Make sure to render you website everytime before you want to upload changes
