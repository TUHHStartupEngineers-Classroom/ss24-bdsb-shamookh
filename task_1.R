# Tidyverse

Last compiled: `r Sys.Date()`

I learned the basics of the tidyverse library throughout the chapter. This includes basic data wrangling and data visualization.

# Challange Nr. 1

Using the bike_orderlines_wrangled_tbl and the knowledge, that I acquired during the exercise, the 'state' and 'city' columns were created, so that the data could be grouped by the state variable only. Sales by location were plotted on a bar plot to gain more insight in their relation.

## Sales by State

sales_by_state <- bike_orderlines_wrangled_tbl %>%
  select(state, total_price) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(sales = sum(total_price))

plot_1 <- sales_by_state %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = state, y = sales)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

According to Figure 1, North Rhine-Westphalia has the largest revenue.

# Challange Nr. 2

Usng the wrangled bike_orderlines_wrangled_tbl, the data frame was grouped by the state and year columns, then the sales in each state were plotted against the year (facet_wrap(\~state)), on a bar plot.

## Sales by State by Year

```{r}

# 5.2 Challange.2
sales_by_state_by_year <- bike_orderlines_wrangled_tbl %>%
  select(state, total_price, order_date) %>%
  mutate(year = format(order_date, format = "%Y")) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(sales = sum(total_price), state = state)

plot2 <- sales_by_state_by_year %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = sales, fill = state)) +
  facet_wrap(~state) +
  geom_col(fill = "#2DC6D6") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) 

plot2
ggsave("./01_tidyverse_files/figure-html/Sales_by_state_by_year.png", height = 7 , width = 10)

```
